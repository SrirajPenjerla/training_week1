'''create a class F15 with functions  lights fan and ac and display
lights:when lights fuc called it prints the colour of the light which is taken as parameter to the func
Fan: when it is called it diplays reg speed in which it is rotating which is taken as parameter for unc
ac: diplays curr room temp and the out side temp which is taken as input
display: whch diplays the diff in outside temp and room temp of ac  and fan speed'''
